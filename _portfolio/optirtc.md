Opti provides technology platform for stormwater management solutions.




Opti technology prepares today's infrastructure for tomorrow's storms.


Opti was built to be the highest value and most easily deployable stormwater management solution. We work with municipalities, private landowners, and large corporations on retrofits and new construction to make infrastructure intelligent.

SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM
THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ESTIMATES THAT OVER 900 BILLION GALLONS OF RAW SEWAGE ARE DISCHARGED INTO NATURAL WATER BODIES EVERY YEAR FROM COMBINED SEWER OVERFLOWS.
RAPID URBAN RUNOFF CAN ALSO POLLUTE RIVERS AND LAKES.
GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE TECHNOLOGIES CAN HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS; HOWEVER, MANY PASSIVE SYSTEMS DO NOT PERFORM OPTIMALLY.
Opti solves these problems.

Read more about stormwater from the US EPA and from the WERF report focused on Opti technology.




OptiRTC, Inc. provides technology solutions for stormwater management. It offers Opti platform, a remote monitoring and active control platform;

 OptiNimbus for intelligent retention of stormwater based on forecasted precipitation data; OptiStratus for predictive maintenance of green and conventional stormwater infrastructure; and OptiCumulus that collects data from on-site sensors in real-time, aggregates it with data from other sources, and presents the data on an interactive Web dashboard for streamlined analysis. The company also provides combined sewer overflow reduction, rainwater harvesting, hydromodification, water quality improvement, stormwater credit markets, green infrastructure.


OptiRTC is an American technology company that has developed a software as a service platform for civil infrastructure. The OptiRTC platform is a cloud-native platform that integrates sensors, forecasts, and environmental contexts to actively control stormwater infrastructure.[1][2] The OptiRTC platform is built on Microsoft Azure and uses internet of things technology to predicatively manage distributed water systems.[3]
