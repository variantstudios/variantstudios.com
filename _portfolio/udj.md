title: UDJ App
description: "UDJ is a startup that was founded by two CSU students that wanted to simplify the process of club goers requesting songs and the process DJs managed those requests. We worked with UDJ to take their initial ideas and designs to a fully functional iOS and Android app. Along with the mobile apps we developed a web-based (and mobile friendly) dashboard for the DJ and one for the Venue. The DJ dashboard allowed the DJ to checkin to their venue and manage the song requests by either accepting or denying them. The Venue dashboard allowed them to create promotions for their customers and also to schedule them in-advance and see how many were redeemed. Since time was of the essence we built there two mobile apps, the DJ and Venue web dashboards in less than two months!"
