title: Greeley D.D.A.
description: "Our first website for the Greeley DDA was designed and built in 2011 and it was time for a serious upgrade from their old Drupal 6 non-responsive website. For their new website we leveraged the Jekyll static site generator and CloudCannon's Content management system. Our goal was to build a clean, modern, mobile-friendly website that was easy for their visitors to navigate, but also easy for the DDA to update their content. "
