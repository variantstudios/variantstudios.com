  copy: 'We had a website for about 4 years before we realized that it was doing very little to promote our business. The economy was in decline, our sales were plummeting, and we needed to do something to capture the small amount of work that was available. We did some research on web designers and SEO and found Variant Studios. We explained to them we needed to build a new website that would generate more business as well as showcase our landscapes. His price was very reasonable and away they went. The process went very smoothly and our new site was unveiled in short order. Our new website is perfect. We had more compliments on our website in the first week than we had in the 4 year life of our old site. Variant raised our relevance with all the search engines and within weeks we seemed to be on the front page of most searches. It seemed as if the phones started ringing again within weeks of launching our website. The most impressive service has been the years after our site was developed. They have built our website in such a way that we can continually make changes to keep the site fresh and www. Whenever we have any problems, they are there to help. They will make the necessary changes to the site and then send us a video with step by step instruction on how we can make these changes ourselves in the future. Construction is down, the economy is down, and many landscapers are closing their doors. We are now in our 16th year of business and we are having our best year ever. I strongly believe that our ability to showcase our work and generate leads from our website is a large part of our success. Variant Studios has fresh ideas and seem to be on the cutting edge of technology. Doing business with Variant Studios has been a pleasure and I would absolutely recommend them.'

  copy: 'Our experience with Variant Studios has been nothing but pleasant. They are a unique company in the way that they truly value customer service and customer satisfaction. We reached out to Variant Studios to have them help us develop a Drupal website for our company. We have used Variant Studios in the past, because their quality of work, professionalism and friendly staff surpasses their competition. Upon brainstorming the development of our site, they listened to our wants and needs and then suggested ways to make that successful on Drupal. They were able to look at the big picture idea with us and them customize it as seen fit for our client population. While working with Variant, they have been always been very quick in response to questions or concerns. For instance, they were out of town on a Drupal conference and still able to assist in a question/concern that was presented. They are very dedicated and loyal to their customers. They also have monitored our site and been communicative with potential problems. The other value that Variant Studios brings is that they are always looking for the next step of cutting edge technology, while also keeping it practical with what is fitting for a specific company. For instance, Variant Studios suggested that we add the mobile friendly feature. This would allow for easier navigation on mobile devices for our patients who were visiting us through that medium. They provide you with personal How To videos so management of your site becomes something you can control, edit and update as needed. Overall, anyone who decides to go with Variant Studios will be happy with the customer service and end product that they provide.'

I’m happy with the outcome and have received positive feedback on the design too. They provided great tutorials to help me manage the website content.

I am looking forward to working with them more as I update my website in the coming years.

  copy: "Variant Studios assisted the Budweiser Events Center in creating a new website that could be easily accessible across all platforms. For us, this means that people can now visit our site from their desktop computer, tablet or phone and see a version that fits that screen size perfectly. In a time where we see more and more of our traffic come from smaller screens, their assistance was instrumental in ensuring that we kept on top of the trends and didn’t lose customers. Additionally, Variant Studios utilized the Drupal content management system that makes it easy and quick to update events, articles and other information. Having a customized Drupal CMS that's been created specifically for what we do on a regular basis has been a game changer for our day to day. Finally, when we have questions on how to tweak our site or to add something new, Variant has always been prompt and attentive to our needs. From a customer service perspective, this puts them ahead of the rest!"

  copy: "It was a pleasure working with Variant Studio for the Greeley Unexpected website. Our team ran into unforeseen problems regarding our campaign imagery (from another vendor), which we considered integral to the design. Despite the compressed time frame, Brent and Michael were able to create a mock up and design that we believe really highlights beautiful aspects of Greeley and piques the curiosity of our website visitors. Additionally, we used tools that kept everyone in constant communication. Any time we came across a problem, Variant Studios responded almost immediately. We appreciate all the work that they’ve done for us and we're excited to continue building our website for Greeley Unexpected campaigns to come!"

  copy: "As a non-profit organization, we rely on the support of local community members and organizations. We have to sell our product – which is being able to encourage kids to stay in school while assisting with the transition to college. With that in mind, it is important that when someone visits our website, they are drawn to us, the services we provide and our purpose. With the former website, we were not able to deliver that. Brent and Michael got our website up and running in a very short period of time just as they promised. The overall look of the website is professional and inviting. Although most of us are somewhat tech savvy, we couldn't understand how our previous website could be so hard to use. After working with Variant Studios, we realized that it wasn't the user but in fact the old site's platform. Behind the scenes, we love the fact that we can now log on to update something and it takes us a matter of minutes. We also love that the user can visit our website and the visual aspects are up-to-date and easy to access. Finally, we like the idea of having Variant Studios right in our back yard. It makes a difference working with a pair who put everything together for us compared to waiting on hold for long periods of time to get assistance. We are grateful that they both were great about follow-up and assisted us with the many questions we had. We are pleased with the new website as well as Variant Studios."
