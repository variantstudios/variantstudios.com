Variant Studios is a full-service web design and web development studio. We are focused on designing beautiful, powerful and easy-to-use websites.

Variant Studios started in Greeley, Colorado in 2002. Brent started working from his basement as a freelancer. It then evolved into a successful business with a talented team of web designers and developers.

In early 2011, we moved to a larger space in the heart of Old Town Fort Collins, Colorado. We have begun working on larger scale projects powered by Drupal.

We are a group of fun people who have a passion for helping businesses succeed online. If you are ever in the neighborhood feel free to drop in to say hi!
