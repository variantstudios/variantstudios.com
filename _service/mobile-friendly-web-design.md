title: Mobile Friendly Web Design
intro: The growth of website visitors using mobile devices or tablets is increasing drastically and those numbers keep climbing. Experts predict in 2015 we will see approximately 50% of all web traffic using a mobile device. It is crucial for website owners to not only consider but to make sure their current website or a new website is optimized for mobile devices.

  <h3>It's all gone mobile Web Design</h3>
  <div class="detail">
    <p>In 2012 we saw an average of 15-25% of mobile visitors to our client’s website (viewing their Google Analytics stats). However, there were some websites that had months where they were averaging 30% or more mobile traffic!</p>
    <p>It is important we are optimizing those mobile visitor’s experience. We do this by leveraging multiple technologies to load smaller image files that scale to the appropriate dimensions (to help make the pages load faster), scale the text to make it easier to read, change the site's menus to make it easier to navigate, avoid loading heavy JavaScripted libraries and more. These techniques help make the pages scale to fit in any screen (handheld, tablet, small laptop, desktops or even TVs), help make the pages load faster, make the menu easier to navigate with your fingers on mobile devices and much more. So no more annoying "pinch-n-zooming" to view content and faster loading times!</p>

  <h3>Why Responsive Web Design</h3>
  <div class="detail">
    <p>We use Responsive (also know as Adaptive) web design so we can use one site to provide your site’s content rather than creating a totally separate website for mobile. Having a separate site for mobile is not optimal for your site's Search Engine Optimization (SEO). Also, a separate mobile site typically targets specific mobile device(s) rather than Responsive, where the site responds or adapts to different screen dimensions. Without getting too technical, Responsive web design can also "respond" to more than just browser width, it can detect for orientation, aspect-ratio, color, resolution and more.</p>
    <p>With Responsive we use the same site (design, structure and content) to make it optimized for many devices and this makes it easier for you to manage the website’s content and also for further development since we do not have to maintain multiple sites.</p>
    <p>We use the Drupal Content Management System (CMS) to build all of our websites and there are many tools (modules) we can utilize to make sure your website is Responsive. </p>
