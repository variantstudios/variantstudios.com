  <h3>Content Is King</h3>
  <div class="detail">
    <p>It is no longer good enough to just have a website online and expect traffic and converting visitors to clients. Your website needs to have relevant, useful and frequently updated content. We call it "sticky" content. This is content that compels visitors to not only come back to the site, but also to share your content with others.</p>
