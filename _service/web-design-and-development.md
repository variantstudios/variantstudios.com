  <h3>Web Design</h3>
  <div class="detail">
    <p>We have a passion for designing creative and interactive websites. We  disign all of our client websites from scratch, so each client has a brand new custom design the meets their needs. Even before the actual design, we create wireframes and "style tiles" to narrow down the look, feel and layout of the website. We work closely with our clients to make sure they are extremely excited and connected with the design throughout the entire process. Once the design is fully approved, we convert the look to a functional Drupal theme using the latest in HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery technology. Even while using the latest in web design technologies we still make the design functional in older, dated browsers using progressive enhancement and graceful degradation.</p>

  <h3>Web Development</h3>
  <div class="detail">
    <p>Our web development consists of crafting robust websites and web applications utilizing the Drupal CMS (Content Management System). With creating custom PHP and jQuery Drupal modules we can add almost any web functionality needed for any project. Before developing a website we go through a planning stage. This is where we outline and create the foundation for the content structure and functionality of the website. This process helps us ensure the success of our client's websites. </p>
